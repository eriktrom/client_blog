The rest of the view files for this rails engine are located in lynnfellman.
For the most part you can bring those files into this engine 'as-is'. The
only caveat is that they reference a - show_sidebar helper located in her 
application helpers and layout view file. Of course the css is needed as well.
Finally, you must generate the migration file and have polymorphihc resources
setup for googlable, imageable, videoable and audioable. But that should do it.

Also, the .gemspec file does not containt all the gems needed to use this blog
in another app. 

Very lastly, the application controller has two expose methods that are being 
referenced in the posts_controller, so you'll need those as well.
